## Planned (Unreleased)
## v2.6.0

This release will focus on adding any new features covered by open issues
* ChefVault::Item#clients can now accept a Chef::ApiClient object instead of a search string.  Requested by @lamont-granquist to make implementing chef-vault into `knife bootstrap` easier

* allow Ruby 1.9.3 failures to not cause the overall build to fail on Travis
* switch to latest 2.0.x, 2.1.x, and 2.2.x releases of Ruby

* add --clean-unknown-clients switch to `knife vault refresh`
* as a side effect, `ChefVault::Item` now has a `#refresh` method which can be used to programatically perform the same operation as `knife vault refresh`
* ChefVault::Item#clients can now accept a Chef::ApiClient object instead of a search string.  Requested by @lamont-granquist to make implementing chef-vault into `knife bootstrap` easier
* allow Ruby 1.9.3 failures to not cause the overall build to fail on Travis
* switch to latest 2.0.x, 2.1.x, and 2.2.x releases of Ruby

## v2.7.0

This release will focus on reducing tech debt:

* improve the coverage of the RSpec suite
* ensure there are Aruba tests for all the subcommands and scenarios that match DEMO.md
* clean up any leftover Rubocop issues

## v2.99.0

This will be the last release in the 2.x branch, and is for anyone who
is constraining to '~> 2.4' (for example).  Anything that we decide to
deprecate for v3.0.0 will produce warnings in this release.

## v3.0.0

This will be a major refactor.  The primary goal is to solve the bootstrap
problem where a vault can't be encrypted for a node until the node has been
created.  Exactly how we will do that is open to discussion (watch the
chef-vault issues on github for news).

This release will also remove the chef-vault 1.x commands (encrypt/decrypt)

## Released
## v2.5.0 / 2015-02-09
* when decrypting, if the vault is encrypted for the node but decryption fails, emit a more friendly error message than 'OpenSSL::PKey::RSAError: padding check failed'
* when attempting to add a client key to a vault item, warn and skip if the node doesn't have a public key (reported by Nik Ormseth)
* add a new 'knife vault list' command that lists the data bags that are vaults
* Add more detailed explanation of how chef-vault works in THEORY.md (Issue #109)
* fix a problem with the --clean-unknown-clients switch to `rotate keys` that made it impossible to delete a client that could not be searched for (i.e. the node object is deleted)
* add rubocop tasks to Rakefile and take a first pass at the low-hanging fruit
